# Chapter 37: Symbol Review

Review 94 symbols in Python 2.7.

## Keywords

* `and` - Logical `and`; Python doesn't support `&&`
* `del` - Deletes an item in a list at an index, does not return itL `del x[1]`
* `from` - Used to specify a method in module: `from math import sqrt()`
* `not` - Logical `not`; `!=` exists but `!!` won't work; `not not` will
* `while` - `while` loop
* `as` - Creates aliases for modules or `with` clause:
    * `import math as m`
    * `with open(file, 'a+') as nice_name`
* `elif` - `else if` equivalent but `else if` doesn't work.
* `global` - Allows you to read/write to global. Similar to PHP:
    *   ```
        x = 0
        def foobar():
            # x = x + 1 # UnboundLocalError: local variable
            global c
            x = x + 1
        ```
* `or` - Logicial `or`; `||` not supported
* `with` - Acts as both a try/catch(except) and an auto closing/releasing of resources:
    *   ```
        with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print line
            ... more processing code ..
        ```
* `assert` - Fairly standard:
    *   ```
        assert x == 0, msg
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        AssertionError: fooba
        ```
* `else` - Self explanatory. EXCEPT `while-else`:
    *   ```
        while x > 0:
            x -= 1
        else:
            print "Loop is done"
            print "Doesn't run if break; or exception happen."
        ```
* `if` -  Self explanatory
* `pass` - null operation; it needs an operation to do something so use pass. Pops up in templates a bit. `class C: pass` `if False: pass`
* `yield` - Used in generators; no surprise here. JavaScript has generators that work the same.
* `break` - break loops. Only loops, no switches. Can't work with functions or classes within those loops. **skipping** the optional else
* `except` - try/catch --> try/except
* `import` - Used to import modules and methods.
* `print` - Prints. This changes Python 3.
* `class` - Self explanatory
* `exec` - Like `eval()` or PHP `exec()`
* `in` - Used to check if value is in sequence. Must be iterable like list or string.
* `raise` - Throw Exception
* `continue` - Self explanatory
* `finally` - Self explanatory
* `is` - Confirms it is the same object (**not** type); `list1 is list`
* `return` - Self explanatory
* `def` - Declare functions
* `for` - Self explanatory
* `lambda` - Much like JavaScript.
    * Syntax is different: `lambda x, y: x + y`.
    * Other names:
        * Anonymous functions
        * Lambda functions
        * Lambda expressions
        * Lambda abstractions
        * Lambda form
        * Function literals
* `try` - Self explanatory

## Data Types

For data types, write out what makes up each one. For example, with strings write out how you
create a string. For numbers, write out a few numbers.
* `True` - Self explanatory
    * **HOWEVER** in Python 2.7 they are variables/objects, in Python 3 they are keywords. This matters because:
    ```
    python
    Python 2.7.12 (default, Apr 15 2020, 17:07:12)
    [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> True
    True
    >>> False
    False
    >>> True, False = False, True
    >>> True
    False
    >>> False
    True
    >>>
    ```
    Which is kind of hilarious.
* `False` - Self explanatory.
    * In Python 2 the following are falsy:
        * `None`
        * `False`
        * zero of any numeric type: `0`, `0L` (long), `0.0` (float), `0j` (imaginary)
        * any empty sequence: `''`, `()`, `[]`
        * any empty mapping: `{}`
        * instance sof user-defined classes if they define `__nonzero__()` or `__len()__` methods that return `0` or `False`.
* `None` - Acts as the null in Python.
* `strings` - sequence of characters. Has a variety of methods:
    * https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
    * TODO
* `numbers` - Four distinct types. Operand with "narrower" type is widened to the other; plain int narrower than long narrower than float narrower than complex.
    * plain `integer()`: `0`
    * `float()`: `0.0`
    * `long()`: `0L`, `0l`
    * `complex()`: `0J`, `0j`
    * https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex
* `floats` - See above
* `lists` -
* `STRINGS` - TODO above [ ]

## String Escape Sequences

For string escape sequences, use them in strings to make sure they do what you think they do.
* `\\` -
* `\'` -
* `\"` -
* `\a` -
* `\b` -
* `\f` -
* `\n` -
* `\r` -
* `\t` -
* `\v` -

## String Formats

Same thing for string formats: use them in some strings to know what they do.
* `%d` -
* `%i` -
* `%o` -
* `%u` -
* `%x` -
* `%X` -
* `%e` -
* `%E` -
* `%f` -
* `%F` -
* `%g` -
* `%G` -
* `%c` -
* `%r` -
* `%s` -
* `%%` -

## Operators

Some of these may be unfamiliar to you, but look them up anyway. Find out what they do, and if
you still canâ€™t figure it out, save it for later.
* `+` -
* `-` -
* `*` -
* `**` -
* `/` -
* `//` -
* `%` -
* `<` -
* `>` -
* `<=` -
* `>=` -
* `==` -
* `!=` -
* `<>` -
* `( )` -
* `[ ]` -
* `{ }` -
* `@` -
* `,` -
* `:` -
* `.` -
* `=` -
* `;` -
* `+=` -
* `- =` -
* `*=` -
* `/=` -
* `//=` -
* `%=` -
* `**=` -
