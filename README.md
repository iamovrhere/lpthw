In my professional coding I've done a bit of dabbling with Python over the years, changing various scripts as needed. However, it was never a mainstay of mine.

Decided to dig in a little more and use, ["Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw](https://learntocodetogether.com/learn-python-the-hard-way-free-ebook-download/) as the structure for it. 

Starting off with Python 2, [which finally hit End of Life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) 2020, before going onto Python 3 (since a lot of projects may be stuck upgrading over the next couple years). Aiming to acquire solid foundation for the language.

Not a project really as much as learning tool.
