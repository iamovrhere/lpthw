# Chapter 36: Symbol Review

Review 94 symbols.

## Keywords

* `and` - Logical `and`; python doesn't support `&&`
* `del` - Deletes an item in a list at an index, does not return itL `del x[1]`
* `from` - Used to specify a method in module: `from math import sqrt()`
* `not` - Logical `not`; `!=` exists but `!!` won't work; `not not` will
* `while` - `while` loop
* `as` - Creates aliases for modules or `with` clause:
    * `import math as m`
    * `with open(file, 'a+') as nice_name`
* `elif` - `else if` equivalent but `else if` doesn't work.
* `global` - Allows you to read/write to global. Similar to PHP:
    *   ```
        x = 0
        def foobar():
            # x = x + 1 # UnboundLocalError: local variable
            global c
            x = x + 1
        ```
* `or` - Logicial `or`; `||` not supported
* `with` - Acts as both a try/catch(except) and an auto closing/releasing of resources:
    *   ```
        with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print line
            ... more processing code ..
        ```
* `assert` - Fairly standard:
    *   ```
        assert x == 0, msg
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        AssertionError: fooba
        ```
* `else` - Self explanatory. EXCEPT `while-else`:
    *   ```
        while x > 0:
            x -= 1
        else:
            print("Loop is done")
        ```
* `if` -  Self explanatory
* `pass` - null operation; it needs an operation to do something so use pass. Pops up in templates a bit. `class C: pass` `if False: pass`
* `yield` - Used in generators; no surprise here. JavaScript has generators that work the same.
* `break` - break loops. Only loops, no switches. Can't work with functions or classes within those loops. **skipping** the optional else
* `except` - try/catch --> try/except
* `import` - Used to import modules and methods.
* `print` - Prints. This changes python 3.
* `class` -
* `exec` -
* `in` -
* `raise` -
* `continue` -
* `finally` -
* `is` -
* `return` - Self explanatory
* `def` -
* `for` -
* `lambda` -
* `try` -

## Data Types

For data types, write out what makes up each one. For example, with strings write out how you
create a string. For numbers, write out a few numbers.
* `True` -
* `False` -
* `None` -
* `strings` -
* `numbers` -
* `floats` -
* `lists` -

## String Escape Sequences

For string escape sequences, use them in strings to make sure they do what you think they do.
* `\\` -
* `\'` -
* `\"` -
* `\a` -
* `\b` -
* `\f` -
* `\n` -
* `\r` -
* `\t` -
* `\v` -

## String Formats

Same thing for string formats: use them in some strings to know what they do.
* `%d` -
* `%i` -
* `%o` -
* `%u` -
* `%x` -
* `%X` -
* `%e` -
* `%E` -
* `%f` -
* `%F` -
* `%g` -
* `%G` -
* `%c` -
* `%r` -
* `%s` -
* `%%` -

## Operators

Some of these may be unfamiliar to you, but look them up anyway. Find out what they do, and if
you still canâ€™t figure it out, save it for later.
* `+` -
* `-` -
* `*` -
* `**` -
* `/` -
* `//` -
* `%` -
* `<` -
* `>` -
* `<=` -
* `>=` -
* `==` -
* `!=` -
* `<>` -
* `( )` -
* `[ ]` -
* `{ }` -
* `@` -
* `,` -
* `:` -
* `.` -
* `=` -
* `;` -
* `+=` -
* `- =` -
* `*=` -
* `/=` -
* `//=` -
* `%=` -
* `**=` -
