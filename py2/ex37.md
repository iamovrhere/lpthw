# Chapter 37: Symbol Review

Review 94 symbols in Python 2.7.

## Keywords

* `and` - Logical `and`; Python doesn't support `&&`
* `del` - Deletes things.
    * An item in a list at an index, does not return it `del x[1]`
    * Delete a range `del x[2:4]`
    * The entire list `del [:]`
    * Delete variables `del x` (becomes not defined)
* `from` - Used to specify a method in module: `from math import sqrt()`
* `not` - Logical `not`; `!=` exists but `!!` won't work; `not not` will
* `while` - Self-explanatory.
    * Has optional `else` clause.
* `as` - Creates aliases for modules or `with` clause:
    * `import math as m`
    * `with open(file, 'a+') as nice_name`
* `elif` - `else if` equivalent but `else if` doesn't work.
* `global` - Allows you to read/write to global. Similar to PHP:
    *   ```
        x = 0
        def foobar():
            # x = x + 1 # UnboundLocalError: local variable
            global c
            x = x + 1
        ```
* `or` - Logicial `or`; `||` not supported
* `with` - Acts as both a try/catch(except) and an auto closing/releasing of resources:
    *   ```
        with open('/etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            print line
            ... more processing code ..
        ```
* `assert` - Fairly standard:
    *   ```
        assert x == 0, msg
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        AssertionError: fooba
        ```
* `else` - Self-explanatory. EXCEPT `while-else`:
    *   ```
        while x > 0:
            x -= 1
        else:
            print "Loop is done"
            print "Doesn't run if break; or exception happen."
        ```
* `if` -  Self-explanatory
* `pass` - null operation; it needs an operation to do something so use pass. Pops up in templates a bit. `class C: pass` `if False: pass`
* `yield` - Used in generators; no surprise here. JavaScript has generators that work the same.
* `break` - break loops. Only loops, no switches. Can't work with functions or classes within those loops. **skipping** the optional else
* `except` - try/catch --> try/except
* `import` - Used to import modules and methods.
* `print` - Prints. This changes Python 3.
* `class` - Self-explanatory
* `exec` - Like `eval()` or PHP `exec()`
* `in` - Used to check if value is in sequence. Must be iterable like list or string.
* `raise` - Throw Exception
* `continue` - Self-explanatory
* `finally` - Self-explanatory
* `is` - Confirms it is the same object (**not** type); `list1 is list2`
* `return` - Self-explanatory
* `def` - Declare functions
* `for` - Self-explanatory
* `lambda` - Much like JavaScript.
    * Syntax is different: `lambda x, y: x + y`.
    * Other names:
        * Anonymous functions
        * Lambda functions
        * Lambda expressions
        * Lambda abstractions
        * Lambda form
        * Function literals
* `try` - Self-explanatory

## Data Types

For data types, write out what makes up each one. For example, with strings write out how you
create a string. For numbers, write out a few numbers.
* `True` - Self-explanatory
    * **HOWEVER** in Python 2.7 they are variables/objects, in Python 3 they are keywords. This matters because:
    ```
    python
    Python 2.7.12 (default, Apr 15 2020, 17:07:12)
    [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> True
    True
    >>> False
    False
    >>> True, False = False, True
    >>> True
    False
    >>> False
    True
    >>>
    ```
    Which is kind of hilarious.
* `False` - Self-explanatory.
    * In Python 2 the following are falsy:
        * `None`
        * `False`
        * zero of any numeric type: `0`, `0L` (long), `0.0` (float), `0j` (imaginary)
        * any empty sequence: `''`, `()`, `[]`
        * any empty mapping: `{}`
        * instance sof user-defined classes if they define `__nonzero__()` or `__len()__` methods that return `0` or `False`.
* `None` - Acts as the null in Python.
* `strings` - sequence of characters. Has a variety of methods:
    * https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
    * `capitalize()` - First char is UPPERCASED by reset is lowercased: `"miXED CaSE".capitalize() # 'Mixed case'`
    * `center(width[, fillchar])` - Returns the string centered using `fillchar` (default space), does not trim existing spaces: `"xyz".center(10) # '   xyz    '`
    * `count(sub[, start, end])` - Count matching occurrences of string in specified range.
    * `encode(...)` `decode(...)` - See: https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings
    * `endswith(suffix[, start, end])` - `True`/`False` if string ends with. Can be a `tuple` (multiple suffixes) as well.
    * `expandtabs([tabsize])` - Converts spaces to tabs.
    * `find(sub[, start, end])` - Like `indexOf` Returns first occurrence of string match in range.
    * `format(*args, **kwargs)` - Basically like the formatting strings we do with `"%s" % (a)`. **Preferred format**
        * https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/string.html#formatstrings
        * **NOTE: In Python 3 this is the preferred format to `"%s" % (a)`**
    * `index(sub[, start, end])` - Like `find` but more aggressive. raises `ValueError` when it doesn't find it.
    *
* `numbers` - Four distinct types. Operand with "narrower" type is widened to the other; plain int narrower than long narrower than float narrower than complex.
    * plain `integer()`: `0`
    * `float()`: `0.0`
    * `long()`: `0L`, `0l`
    * `complex()`: `0J`, `0j`
    * https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-long-complex
* `floats` - See above
* `lists` - A sequence type similar to arrays. Methods:
    * `list.append(x)` - Self-explanatory
    * `list.extend(L)` - Appends the parameter list to the extended list.
    * `list.insert(i, x)` - Self-explanatory. Index larger than list is the end, negative index will be start.
    * `list.remove(i)` - Self-explanatory. Error for no such item.
    * `list.index(x)` - Returns the index of first item to match x. **Error for no item.**
    * `list.count(x)` - Returns the number of times item if found in list. **Safe for no match.**
    * `list.sort(cmp=None, key=None, reverse=False)`
        * `cmp` - Comparison function to use: `cmp=lambda x,y: cmp(x.lower(), y.lower()`
        * `key` - The function to apply to values as a sorting key: `key=str.lower`
        * `reverse` - Sort reverse.
    * `reverse()` - Reverse the contents (not sorted, per se)
    * Consider also list comprehensions:
        * `squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]` -> `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`
        * `[(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in [3, 1, 4] if x != y]` -> `[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]`
* `STRINGS` -
    - TODO above [ ]

## String Escape Sequences

For string escape sequences, use them in strings to make sure they do what you think they do.
* `\\` -
* `\'` -
* `\"` -
* `\a` -
* `\b` -
* `\f` -
* `\n` -
* `\r` -
* `\t` -
* `\v` -

## String Formats

Same thing for string formats: use them in some strings to know what they do.
* `%d` -
* `%i` -
* `%o` -
* `%u` -
* `%x` -
* `%X` -
* `%e` -
* `%E` -
* `%f` -
* `%F` -
* `%g` -
* `%G` -
* `%c` -
* `%r` -
* `%s` -
* `%%` -

## Operators

Some of these may be unfamiliar to you, but look them up anyway. Find out what they do, and if
you still canâ€™t figure it out, save it for later.
* `+` -
* `-` -
* `*` -
* `**` -
* `/` -
* `//` -
* `%` -
