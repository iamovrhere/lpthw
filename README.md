In my professional coding I've done a bit of dabbling with Python over the years, changing various scripts as needed. However, it was never a mainstay of mine and more the occasional one- off script.

Decided to dig in a little more and use, ["Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw](https://learntocodetogether.com/learn-python-the-hard-way-free-ebook-download/) as a structure way to learn more details of the syntax. Additionally, good way to review the book as an intro for new developers. May recommend to a friend.

Merited I'll likely go off script for this since that's how I learn best with these things.

Starting off with Python 2, [which finally hit End of Life](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) 2020, before going onto Python 3 (since a lot of projects may be stuck upgrading over the next couple years). Aiming to acquire solid foundation for the language.

Not a project really as much as learning tool.

## Running

1. `cd py2`
1. `python [exercise.py]`
